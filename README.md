# Glass Type Classification Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the type of glass based on its chemical element composition. Different types of glasses have various applications, and accurate classification can help identify their suitability for specific uses. In this project, a Random Forest Classifier is employed to classify glass types using the composition of chemical elements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of the percentages of different chemical elements found in various glass samples. Each sample is labeled with the corresponding glass type. The dataset provides valuable information for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Approach
The project was developed using Jupyter Notebook, which provides an interactive environment for data analysis and model development. The following steps were followed:

1. Data Analysis: The dataset was thoroughly analyzed to gain insights into the distribution of chemical elements and glass types. Exploratory data analysis techniques were employed to understand the relationships and patterns present in the data.

2. Data Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed to handle any missing values, normalize or standardize the data, and split it into training and testing sets. This step is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the machine learning model.

3. Random Forest Classifier: A machine learning model based on the Random Forest Classifier algorithm was chosen for glass type classification. This algorithm is well-suited for handling multi-class classification tasks and is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data effectively.

4. Model Training and Evaluation: The Random Forest Classifier was trained using the preprocessed data and evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation techniques were employed to obtain reliable performance estimates.

5. Model Deployment: The trained Random Forest Classifier model was deployed using the Django framework. Django provides a powerful and scalable environment for building web applications, allowing users to interact with the model and obtain predictions based on glass compositions.

## Tools and Packages
The project utilized the following tools and packages:

- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive development environment for data analysis and model development.
- scikit-learn (sklearn): A machine learning library that provides various algorithms and tools for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- Django: A high-level Python web framework that simplifies the development of web applications.
- HTML: A markup language used for designing the user interface of the web application.

## Conclusion
Through this project, a Random Forest Classifier model was developed to predict the type of glass based on its chemical element composition. The integration of scikit-learn, Django, and HTML enabled the deployment of the model as a web application, allowing users to interactively obtain predictions.

The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for classifying glass types and highlights the potential for leveraging web technologies to make the model accessible to a broader audience.
